* Notes on contributing:
Please let me know of any corrections.  I am open to suggestions for additions, subject to the following guidelines:
- I will not consider suggestions made less than one week before final exam.  There is too much potential for ``last-minute'' mistakes to arise.
- my preference is to receive suggestions as github pull requests, but e-mail is acceptable.
- if you send e-mail, please provide latex code.  [[http://www.overleaf.com]] is a good way to check your code online.
- a useful utility for generating latex code from images of formulae is available at https://mathpix.com/ (unfortunately closed source). 
- please provide a reference for your suggestions. (I'm working on inserting more references into latex source code.)  An authoritative reference for mathematical results is the NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF) [[https://dlmf.nist.gov]] or its predecessor /Handbook of Mathematical Functions/, Abramowitz and Stegun,  http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/ .  The NIST DLMF also contains the latex code for all of the equations (click the circled *i* to the right of each equation).
- I use lualatex to compile (see [[./Makefile]] ).  This will be irrelevant for most contributions, unless you wish to make use of some of lualatex's features.

* Notes on sources:
- the table of constants is adapted from: [[http://johanw.home.xs4all.nl/contents.html]]
- the Clebsch-Gordan table is from: http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/reviews/rpp2018-rev-clebsch-gordan-coefs.pdf
